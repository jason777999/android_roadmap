Based on the [Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) that help web developers with a path of what to learn on this extense area, we developed the Android Developer Roadmap with the same goal.

We hope that with this roadmap new developers find it easier to start building beautiful android applications.
